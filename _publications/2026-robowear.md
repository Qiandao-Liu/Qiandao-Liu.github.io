## Abstract

This work addresses the challenging problem of robot-assisted dressing, specifically focusing on helping individuals put on T-shirts. We develop learned cloth bunching strategies combined with force-limited diffusion policies to enable safe and effective long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects.

## Key Contributions

- Developed learned cloth bunching strategies for efficient dressing
- Implemented force-limited diffusion policies for safe human-robot interaction
- Addressed long-horizon manipulation challenges in assistive robotics
