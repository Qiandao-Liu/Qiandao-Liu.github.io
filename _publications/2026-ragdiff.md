## Abstract

RAG-Diff introduces a novel approach to adapt diffusion policies for robotic manipulation tasks by incorporating retrieval-augmented guidance. This enables robots to dynamically adjust their behavior based on task constraints and environmental context.

## Key Innovations

- Integration of retrieval-augmented generation with diffusion-based robot policies
- Dynamic adaptation to changing task constraints
- Improved generalization across diverse manipulation scenarios
