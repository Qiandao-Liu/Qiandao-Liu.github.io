## Project Overview

RoboWear is a research project focused on enabling robots to assist with dressing tasks, specifically putting on T-shirts. This challenging manipulation task requires handling deformable objects (cloth) and ensuring safe, force-limited interactions with humans.

**Status**: Under Review at RSS 2026

**Lab**: [Cornell EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/)

## Team

Pranav Thakkar, **Qiandao Liu**, Rolando Rodríguez, Keya Aggarwal, Shengmiao Jin, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee

## Key Contributions

- Developed learned cloth bunching strategies for efficient dressing
- Implemented force-limited diffusion policies for safe human-robot interaction
- Addressed long-horizon manipulation challenges in assistive robotics

## Technical Highlights

- **Cloth Manipulation**: Learning-based approaches for handling deformable objects
- **Safety**: Force-limited control for safe physical human-robot interaction
- **Long-horizon Planning**: Breaking down complex dressing tasks into manageable sub-tasks

## Impact

This work contributes to assistive robotics, particularly for individuals with limited mobility who may need assistance with activities of daily living.
