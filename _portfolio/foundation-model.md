## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing foundation models specifically designed for robot assistant care-giving tasks. The goal is to create generalizable models that can perform various assistive tasks to help individuals with daily activities.

**Status**: In Submission to CoRL 2026

**Lab**: [Cornell EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/)

## Research Focus

Foundation models have shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision. This project extends these capabilities to physical assistive robotics, enabling robots to:

- Understand and execute complex care-giving tasks
- Adapt to diverse user needs and preferences
- Generalize across different assistive scenarios

## Technical Contributions

- Development of large-scale models for assistive robotics
- Multi-modal learning combining vision, language, and action
- Evaluation on diverse care-giving tasks

## Impact

This research aims to make assistive robots more capable and accessible, potentially improving the quality of life for elderly individuals and people with disabilities.

## Future Directions

- Expanding the model to handle more complex care-giving scenarios
- Improving safety and reliability in real-world deployments
- User studies to validate effectiveness in actual care settings
