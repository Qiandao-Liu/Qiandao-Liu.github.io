## Project Overview

RAG-Diff introduces a novel approach to adapt diffusion policies for robotic manipulation tasks by incorporating retrieval-augmented guidance. This enables robots to dynamically adjust their behavior based on task constraints and environmental context.

**Status**: Under Review at RSS 2026

**Lab**: [Cornell EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/)

## Team

Ruolin Ye, Sarah Ha, Shuaixing Chen, **Qiandao Liu**, Gavin Chen, Shaoyang Stassen, Mark Zolotas, Jose Barreiros, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee

## Key Innovations

- Integration of retrieval-augmented generation with diffusion-based robot policies
- Dynamic adaptation to changing task constraints
- Improved generalization across diverse manipulation scenarios

## Technical Approach

- **Diffusion Policies**: Leveraging generative models for robot policy learning
- **Retrieval-Augmented Guidance**: Using relevant examples to guide policy execution
- **Constraint Handling**: Adapting to dynamic environmental and task constraints

## Applications

This work has applications in adaptive robotic manipulation, enabling robots to handle diverse tasks with varying constraints and requirements.
