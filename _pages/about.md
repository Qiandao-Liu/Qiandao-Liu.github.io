Hi! I'm Qiandao Liu (刘乾道).

Research Interests
======
My research lies at the intersection of robotics, learning, and control. I am focused on enabling robots to perform useful tasks with adaptability, agility, generalizability, and safety, utilizing learning-based methods that scale with data and computation.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the [Cornell EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/), working with [Professor Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://sites.google.com/site/tapomayukh) on robot learning for assistive care-giving tasks.

Education
======
**Cornell University**, Ithaca, NY (Aug 2023 - Dec 2026 Expected)
