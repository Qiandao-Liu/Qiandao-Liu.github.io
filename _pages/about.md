<br>
I am a third year undergraduate student in Computer Science at Cornell University. I was fortunate to work in the [EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/), advised by [Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://sites.google.com/site/tapomayukh) on robot assistive care-giving tasks.

**Research Interest:** My research lies at the intersection of robotics, learning, and control. I am focused on enabling robots to perform useful tasks with adaptability, agility, generalizability, and safety, utilizing learning-based methods that scale with data and computation.
